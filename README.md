A machine learning model to predict Titanic survivors based on passenger data using Python, Scikit-Learn, and Pandas.
It is a binary classification task that predicts whether a passenger survived based on factors like age, gender, class, and ticket price. It uses machine learning models trained on the famous Titanic incident.

The dataset contains:
PassengerId
Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass (Ticket class)
Name
Sex
Age
SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
Ticket (Ticket number)
Fare
Cabin
Embarked (Port of embarkation)

Model Training Steps
-Data Preprocessing
-Handling missing values
-Encoding categorical features
-Feature scaling
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Visualizing survival rates by gender, class, age, etc.
-Model Selection(Logistic regression)
-Evaluation & Performance Metrics(Accuracy from sklearn)
